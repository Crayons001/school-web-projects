                    <h1>Let's do trees!</h1>
                 Forests are vast, diverse ecosystems that cover around 31% of the Earth's land surface. They are home to countless species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, and they play a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide.

                Forests can be broadly classified into two types: tropical forests and temperate forests. Tropical forests are found near the equator and are characterized by high temperatures and rainfall, while temperate forests are found in areas with distinct seasons and moderate temperatures.

                    <h2>Why plant trees?</h2>
                    Tree planting is the process of establishing new trees in an area where there are none or where previous trees have been removed. This process is important for many reasons, including reforestation, erosion control, habitat restoration, and carbon sequestration.

                    Reforestation is the process of planting trees in areas that have been deforested or destroyed by natural disasters such as wildfires, landslides, or floods. This process helps to restore ecosystems, prevent soil erosion, and provide habitat for wildlife. <br><br>

                    Erosion control is another important reason for tree planting. Trees help to stabilize soil by preventing erosion and reducing the amount of runoff that can occur during heavy rain. This is especially important in areas that are prone to landslides or soil erosion. <br><br>

                    Tree planting is also used for habitat restoration. By planting trees in areas where natural habitats have been destroyed, we can help to restore ecosystems and provide habitat for animals that may have lost their homes.

                    Another important reason for tree planting is carbon sequestration. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and store it in their wood, leaves, and roots. This process helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is important for mitigating climate change.

                    <h2>10 Random facts about trees!</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The world's tallest tree is a coast redwood named Hyperion, which measures 379.7 feet (115.7 meters) tall</li>
                        <li>Trees can communicate with each other through underground networks of fungi known as mycorrhizae. These networks allow trees to share nutrients, defend against pests, and warn each other of danger.</li>
                        <li>The oldest tree in the world is a Great Basin bristlecone pine named Methuselah, which is over 4,800 years old.</li>
                        <li>The process of photosynthesis in trees produces oxygen, which is essential for all animal life on Earth.</li>
                        <li>The rings in a tree trunk can be used to determine the tree's age, as well as to reveal information about past climate conditions.</li>
                        <li>Trees can help to mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their wood, leaves, and roots.</li>
                        <li>Some trees have been known to live for thousands of years, such as the giant sequoia and the oak tree.</li>
                        <li>Trees play an important role in ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, as well as by filtering air and water.</li>
                        <li>Some species of trees, such as the eucalyptus tree, release oils that can help to repel insects and pests.</li>
                        <li>Trees have been used by humans for thousands of years for a wide range of purposes, including building materials, fuel, medicine, and food.</li>
